# About

I am a Frontend Developer and Architect at [Tietoevry](https://www.tietoevry.com/) in Malmö, Skåne. My specialty lies in building scalable and robust frontend systems.

Throughout my professional journey, I've been involved in a wide variety of projects, each presenting distinct obstacles and opportunities for growth.

I adopt a comprehensive view of frontend architecture, considering aspects from user experience to code optimization.

In today's digital world, I take pride in creating frontend systems that are not only scalable and efficient, but also accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or devices.
